## Bitmind Digital Registry using the Bitcoin Blockchain as a persistence layer (testnet)

### Goals:

* Create organizational scaffolds in seconds
* Register organizations in the Bitcoin blockchain (testnet)
* Create private/public key pairs for organizational assets in the bitcoin blockchain
* Eventually connect the created organizations with the corresponding DAOs/DCOs or other crypto-tokens (live on the Ethereum blockchain such as described here: https://github.com/bitmindco/ethereum-blockchain-contracts).
